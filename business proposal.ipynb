With a recorded population of 2,731,571, it is the most populous city in Canada and the fourth most populous city in North America. The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe, an urban agglomeration of 9,245,438 people (as of 2016) surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario, while the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) proper had a 2016 population of 6,417,516. Toronto is an international center of business, finance, arts, and culture and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities globally.\n\nThe diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada. More than 50 percent of residents belong to a visible minority population group, and over 200 distinct ethnic origins are represented among its inhabitants. While most Torontonians speak English as their primary language, over 160 languages are spoken in the city.\n\nToronto is a prominent center for music, theatre, motion picture production, and television production and is home to the headquarters of Canada's major national broadcast networks and media outlets. Its various cultural institutions, including numerous museums and galleries, festivals and public events, entertainment districts, national historic sites, and sports activities, attract over 43 million tourists each year. Toronto is known for its many skyscrapers and high-rise buildings, particularly the tallest free-standing structure in the Western Hemisphere, the CN Tower. "

To do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm. Besides, we will try to find the best k-value for clustering optimization."
